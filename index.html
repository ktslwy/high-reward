      <p>Making video games is probably a common dream of many kids, especially those who eventually choose a career in software development. As we grow up, this thought is often put aside while we deal with other priorities in our lives. I just never forget about it. Every once in a while, the thought of making something fun rings in my mind. I know I have to put it into action. This is one of my favorite games when I was a kid. If I am making a game, the first one must be something similar to this game, because I have a lot of idea that I want to add to it.</p>

      <h3><a id="the-original-game" class="anchor" href="#the-original-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Original Game</h3>
      <img src="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/sawachin/sawachin/pc/98/hr/high_r.gif"></img>
      <p>The original game was released by Enix in Japan more than 20 years ago. Enix is the former company of Square Enix that released the Final Fantasy series and other great games. Put simply, this is a role-playing strategy game. There is no official website for such an old game. To learn more about the original game, this is a <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/sawachin/sawachin/pc/98/hr/high_r.htm">fan site</a> in Japanese. I also want to make it clear that I remake the game as a fan and not for benefiting from it in any means.</p>

      <h3><a id="the-process" class="anchor" href="#the-process" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Process</h3>
      <p>The first time I tried it is for a school project of the class about Object-oriented programming. It did not end well because of the short timeframe of the project, and also because of my immature programming skill plus the bad choice of programming language, which is Java.<p>
      <p>The second time when I tried it, it is during the rise of HTML5 game development. I picked one of the canvas-based game development library and started working with it. While the library added WebGL support in a major release, there were some incompatible interface change that I did not get past. I also had trouble obtaining graphical assets that fit the game. Because of these, I gradually stopped working on it.</p>
      <p>Now I am trying it the third time. It seems each time I am making it further and I think I am making it pretty far this time.</p>

      <h3><a id="the-third-time" class="anchor" href="#the-third-time" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Third Time</h3>
      <p>To get past the previous failures, I know I have to depend on a library that is reliable, has a good track record and has a large community support. By searching and peeking what others are using, I picked <a href="http://phaser.io/">phaser</a>. For the graphics, I know I have no artistic talent, so why not just reuse the graphics from the original game? I will just focus on the coding part of the game, which is what I am good at.</p>

      <h3><a id="work-in-progress" class="anchor" href="#work-in-progress" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Work in Progress</h3>
      <p>Be warned that this is still work in progress. The character is limited to move in one region of the world. The battle calculation formula is not balanced well. The translation is not professionally done. A lot of features have not been implemented. And there must be hidden bugs that I did not notice when I test it, but I think it is in a playable state that I can share with others.</p>
